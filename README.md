patat
=====

`patat` (Presentations In The ANSI Terminal) is a small tool that allows you to
show presentations using only an ANSI terminal.  It does not require `ncurses`.

`patat` is written in [Haskell] and built upon the great [Pandoc] library.  This
means it is not limited to Markdown, but it supports basically every input
format that Pandoc supports.

_"Patat"_ is the Flemish word for a simple potato.  Dutch people also use it to
refer to French Fries but I don't really do that -- in Belgium we just call
fries _"Frieten"_.
